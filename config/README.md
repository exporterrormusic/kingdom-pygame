# Game Configuration

This directory is reserved for game configuration files.

## Potential Configuration Files

- `settings.json`: Game settings (graphics, audio, controls)
- `controls.json`: Key binding configurations
- `balance.json`: Game balance parameters (enemy health, spawn rates, etc.)
- `graphics.json`: Display and rendering settings

## Current Status

Configuration is currently handled via constants in the source code.
This directory is prepared for future configuration file support.
