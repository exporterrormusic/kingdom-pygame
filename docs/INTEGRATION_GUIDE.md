# Quick Integration Guide

## ✅ **Import Issue Fixed!**

The relative import error has been resolved. The original game now works perfectly, and sprites are available as an **optional enhancement**.

## 🎮 **Using Sprites in Your Game**

### **Option 1: Keep Using Current Player (Recommended)**
Your existing game works unchanged:
```python
# main.py - no changes needed
from src.player import Player
player = Player(x, y)  # Works exactly as before
```

### **Option 2: Upgrade to Animated Player**
To add sprite support, replace the player creation in main.py:

```python
# Replace this line in main.py:
from src.player import Player

# With this:
from src.animated_player import AnimatedPlayer as Player

# Then create player with sprites:
player = Player(SCREEN_WIDTH // 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2, 
                "assets/images/your_character.png", 32, 32)

# Or without sprites (identical to original):
player = Player(SCREEN_WIDTH // 2, SCREEN_HEIGHT // 2)
```

## 🔧 **Testing Your Setup**

### **1. Test Current Game (No Changes)**
```bash
python main.py
```
Should work exactly as before ✅

### **2. Test Sprite System**
```bash
python test_sprites.py
```
Creates example sprites and tests the animation system ✅

### **3. Try Interactive Demo**
```bash
python sprite_demo.py
```
Compare geometric vs sprite rendering side-by-side ✅

## 📁 **Adding Your Own Sprites**

1. **Save your 3x4 sprite sheet** to `assets/images/character.png`
2. **Note your frame dimensions** (e.g., 32x32 pixels)
3. **Update player creation** in main.py:
   ```python
   player = Player(x, y, "assets/images/character.png", 32, 32)
   ```
4. **Run the game** - animations will automatically work with movement!

## 🎯 **What Works Now**

- ✅ **Original game**: Runs perfectly unchanged
- ✅ **Sprite loading**: Automatic with error fallback
- ✅ **Animation system**: Complete 3x4 grid support
- ✅ **Camera shake**: Works with sprites
- ✅ **Hit effects**: Red flash overlay on sprites
- ✅ **Import compatibility**: Fixed relative import issues

The sprite system is now **ready to use** but completely **optional** - your game continues working exactly as before!
