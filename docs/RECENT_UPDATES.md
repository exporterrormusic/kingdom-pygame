# Kingdom-Pygame Updates Summary

## Recent Enhancements ✅

### 🎮 **Animation System Improvements**
- **Idle Animation**: Characters now show only the first frame when not moving
- **Reverse Playback**: When moving backwards (opposite to aiming direction), animations play in reverse
- **Smart Direction Logic**: Character sprite faces aiming direction, not movement direction
- **Enhanced Animation Controls**: Added `pause_animation()`, `show_first_frame()`, and reverse playback support

### 🗂️ **Project Cleanup**
- **Consolidated Game Files**: Merged all functionality into single `main.py`
- **Removed Test Files**: Cleaned up `test_*.py` files to reduce clutter
- **Streamlined Codebase**: Single main game file with full character selection and sprite support

### 🎨 **Character Selection Menu Redesign**
- **Grid Layout**: Changed from vertical list to 4-column grid layout
- **Better Space Usage**: Makes full use of horizontal screen space
- **Improved Navigation**: 
  - Arrow keys or WASD for movement
  - Left/Right for horizontal navigation
  - Up/Down for vertical navigation
- **Enhanced Visual Design**:
  - Selection highlights with glow effects
  - Centered character previews
  - Clean grid-based organization
  - Better typography and spacing

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### Animation System (`src/sprite_animation.py`)
```python
# New animation states
self.reverse_playback = False  # For backwards movement
self.is_playing = False        # Animation state control

# Smart direction detection
opposite_directions = {
    'up': 'down', 'down': 'up',
    'left': 'right', 'right': 'left'
}
is_moving_backwards = movement_direction == opposite_directions.get(facing_direction, '')
```

### Character Selection (`src/character_manager.py`)
```python
# Grid layout calculations
self.columns = 4  # 4 characters per row
self.rows = (len(characters) + self.columns - 1) // self.columns

# Grid navigation
new_row = (self.selected_index // self.columns) + direction
new_index = new_row * self.columns + col
```
