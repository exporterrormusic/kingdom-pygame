# Camera Shake and Bullet Speed Update Summary

## Completed Features ✅

### 1. Bullet Speed Increase
- **Change**: Increased bullet speed from 400 to 800 pixels per second
- **File**: `src/bullet.py`
- **Impact**: Bullets now move twice as fast for more responsive gameplay

### 2. Camera Shake System Implementation
- **Feature**: Complete camera shake system for enhanced visual feedback
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `main.py`: Added camera shake variables and methods
  - `src/player.py`: Added hit flash effect and dash camera shake trigger
  - `src/bullet.py`: Updated render methods for camera offset
  - `src/enemy.py`: Updated render methods for camera offset  
  - `src/collision.py`: Updated effects render methods for camera offset

#### Camera Shake Details:
- **Dash Shake**: Light shake (intensity: 5.0, duration: 0.2s) when player dashes
- **Hit Shake**: Strong shake (intensity: 15.0, duration: 0.4s) when player takes damage
- **Visual System**: Camera offset applied to all game objects except UI
- **Flash Effect**: Player sprite flashes red when hit with smooth fade

### 3. Technical Implementation
- **Camera Offset System**: All render methods now accept offset parameter
- **Single-Press Dash**: Maintained existing single-press dash mechanics
- **Hit Flash**: Red color blending for player damage feedback
- **Shake Fade**: Camera shake intensity fades over time for smooth effect

## How It Works

### Camera Shake Mechanism:
1. **Trigger Events**: Dash or player hit calls `add_camera_shake(intensity, duration)`
2. **Update Loop**: `update_camera_shake(dt)` calculates random offset based on intensity
3. **Render System**: All game objects rendered with camera offset, UI remains stable
4. **Fade Effect**: Shake intensity decreases over time until duration expires

### Player Hit Feedback:
1. **Camera Shake**: Strong shake triggered on player-enemy collision
2. **Red Flash**: Player sprite color blends with red for visual feedback
3. **Flash Duration**: 0.3 seconds with smooth fade-out effect
4. **Combined Effect**: Camera shake + red flash creates impactful hit feedback

## Testing Results ✅
- All camera shake functionality tested and working
